                                                                     Project Introduction
	The project I am hoping to make is a calculator. The calculator will have similar features as the one you can find just by looking up calculator 
on Google. It won't have features that are specific to scientific calculators or buisness calculators, but it will be able to calculate things like 
multiplication, additon, subtraction, divison, trig functions, rationals, exponentials, and logirithms.
